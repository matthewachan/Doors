# Description
This project was built with my team during a UCLA Hackday event. I am currently working on finishing the game by finishing the design of the game and adding more functionality. The player must trek through the horror game and reach the end of the level by opening a series of doors. Depending on which path the user takes, monsters will appear behind the doors.
